      <p>
        Welcome to Bear's Grocery Store! We are just starting out, and although we currently offer a limited array of groceries, 
        we are committed to catering to the needs of students by providing affordable groceries. 
        We offer only on-campus delivery and pickup options to ensure that students at Morgan State University can easily access what they need.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to help new and current students at Morgan have access to affordable groceries.
